        <h2>Hi, I'm Manikandan</h2>
        <p>I’m a Graphic Designer with over 5 years of professional experience, trained at Zoho Schools of Learning — Zoho’s in-house alternative to traditional college education.

            I took a non-traditional path, skipping the degree and diving straight into real-world learning inside Zoho Corporation. Over the years, I’ve created designs that are both visually striking and functionally sound — from digital campaigns to product visuals.
            
            Alongside design, I’ve also picked up front-end development skills at a beginner level, giving me a better understanding of how my designs translate into code. This helps me work smoothly with developers and think more holistically about user experiences.
            
            I'm now looking to bring my creativity, curiosity, and hands-on experience to new opportunities where design meets purpose.</p>
